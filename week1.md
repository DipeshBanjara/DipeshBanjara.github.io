During the first week, I met with Dr. Oludare and my mentor Pelumi to discuss the project that I will be working on and gained an understanding of what Dr. Oludare will be looking for.We had our lunch together and discussed about the project to make the best.
My accomplishment is to learn something from the project mentors and other mentors and to do the research, knowledge in the project and to takeout the good  best output.I got to know about the basic python and sabout the library like numpy.I got some idea about the github and pandas too.I didn't face any inssue in the first week.
