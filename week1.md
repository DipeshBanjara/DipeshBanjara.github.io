I was  looking for an internship.I was like, I really need to do internship in this summer to learn something, to make new friends, to do research, and to make my resume good and better.Being an internation student there are so many criteria and so many thing that need to be done within certain period of time.So,this internship was and is really important for me.I was not selected during the first call of this internship and I was pretty disappoited.After 12 days I got an email from Dr. Naja Mack telling that I was selcted for the intern then I was more than happy.I would like to thank her from my heart for the opportunity.
During the first week, I met with Dr. Oludare and my mentor Pelumi to discuss the project that I will be working on and gained an understanding of what Dr. Oludare will be looking for.We had our lunch together and discussed about the project to make the best.
My accomplishment is to learn many rhings from the project mentors and other mentors and to do the research, knowledge in the project and to takeout the good and best output.I got to know about the basic python and about the library like numpy.I got some idea about the github, pandas.I didn't face any inssue in the first week.I had variety of foods for the whole week.I got to learn so many things from the presentation that the mentors prepared for us.
