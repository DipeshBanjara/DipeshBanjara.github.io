Since Monday was my last day working in the lab on this research project, I arrived at the lab on Monday and we began with a meeting.First up was the last presentation.I began preparing the final slides and practicing them with my teammate.I also attempted to run the code at the video's and picture's low frame rate.My accuracy rate was 51%.My mentor assisted us with it and the presentation throughout the entire day.

Our presentation was scheduled to be given on Tuesday.I visited the Building for Business and Management.When I went there, I was really terrified.I suppose everyone was anxious, including me.We started our presentation on line four.I went over each group's presentation to see what they had accomplished by the project's conclusion.We spent the entire day there.
