As per normal, I arrived at my lab on Monday and we began with a meeting with Pelumi, our graduate mentor.The topic of how to construct a parking space counter in Google Colab was explored.Following the meeting, construction on a Google Colab began.By modeling a parking place, we hope to demonstrate our sample model to high school students.It's very difficult and challenging to find out.That is what we did all day long.Additionally, we met with Dr. Anita Pandey to talk about presentation techniques and considerations for giving a presentation in front of an audience..We also discussed about the papers(intriduction,literature review, methodology, findings and the conclusion)

I arrived in my lab and we resumed our mentor Pelumi's meeting.Our goal was to create a prototype model that would indicate the number of car parking spots that are available as well as the number of spaces that are being used.We grabbed a video off of a webpage that showed the small grocery store parking lot.We attempted to debug the code for the entire week after we began coding in a Google Colab and encountered numerous issues that prevented us from running the code.

When I arrived at the lab, we were under a lot of pressure to present our prototype to our high school students, but we were also dealing with a lot of problems and mistakes.We were meeting with the mentor, but once again, it was difficult to find every bug and solve the issue.Himal and I decided that the best way to tackle the issue would be to go to the PyCharm and watch some of the YouTube videos.We worked on it all afternoon, and we were able to solve the issue.We succeeded in enhancing our Thursday.

We were unable to utilize the projector due to a technical issue when I visited the lab on Thursday to see whether we could use it to show high school pupils.I rehearsed presenting the presentation with my friend.We were prepared to present our prototype and our slides.Students from high schools arrived around ten in the morning and began presenting the material.We were responding to their questions while they were posing them.After ten minutes, they departed, and we were prepared to receive the second group.We did a better job with our presentation than the last one.We got to work on the paper.

We arrived at our lab on Friday and got to work on a video and set of presentation slides for the weekly report.Our mentor had been out of state since last Monday, so we were missing him.He visited our lab today, and we got to work discussing the July 3 presentation.We worried about it greatly.He gave us advice on how to improve and assured us that we could do our best.In addition, he reviewed our slides, had a discussion with us, and assisted us in making changes.By the end of the day, we had begun composing the synopsis from our prototype.
