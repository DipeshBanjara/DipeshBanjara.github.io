As per normal, I arrived at my lab on Monday and we began with a meeting with Pelumi, our graduate mentor.The topic of how to construct a parking space counter in Google Colab was explored.He made fun of us for not being able to watch the movie and create a simple model like the man was.Following the meeting, construction on a Google Colab began.By modeling a parking place, we hope to demonstrate our sample model to high school students.It's very difficult and challenging to find out.That is what we did all day long.Additionally, we met with Dr. Anita Pandey to talk about presentation techniques and considerations for giving a presentation in front of an audience..We also discussed about the papers(intriduction,literature review, methodology, findings and the conclusion)
