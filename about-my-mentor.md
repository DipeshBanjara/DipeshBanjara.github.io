## About My Mentor

In the summer of 2010, Dr. Owolabi, P.E., became a faculty member at Morgan State University (MSU). In addition to leading the Undergraduate Geotechnical Laboratory at the Civil Engineering Department, he is the Director of the Sustainable Infrastructure Development, Smart Innovation, and Resilient Engineering Research Laboratory. He held the position of acting Associate Chair at the Civil Engineering department in 2020. Approximately thirty years of exceptional expertise in civil and transportation engineering practice, teaching, and research are behind him. Both a master's degree in civil engineering (transportation engineering) and a doctorate in civil and environmental engineering from the esteemed Federal University of Technology, Akure, Nigeria, were obtained by Dr. Owolabi in 2007. At the prestigious Obafemi Awolowo University in Ile-Ife, Nigeria, he earned his Bachelor of Science in civil engineering in 1991. He successfully guided the department to achieve another six-year accreditation cycle in 2019 while serving as the Accreditation Board of Engineering and Technology (ABET) Accreditation Coordinator. This was the first time in the department's history that such a feat had been accomplished.

Additionally, Dr. Owolabi has been awarded the Outstanding Faculty Award for Excellence in Service by Morgan State University for 2020. He is a computational mechanics and advanced modeling expert. His primary areas of interest in research are geotechnical engineering, engineering education, the development of sustainable infrastructure, computational geomechanics, pavement engineering, soil mechanics, soil structure modeling—both physically and numerically—constitutive modeling, pavement design, the characterization and prediction of pavement material behavior, linear and non-linear finite element applications in geotechnical engineering, analysis of geo-structural systems, structural mechanics, and material model development.Being able to handle the difficulties of advanced material research and development requires both practical expertise with the most sophisticated numerical analytic tools and knowledge of material constitutive relations, which is why he is regarded as a model of a modern engineer.

About 2.46 million dollars in research funds that have been won by Dr. Owolabi as Principal Investigator or Co-PI have addressed societal issues in transportation engineering, encouraged the construction of sustainable infrastructure, and increased student interest in STEM subjects. At Morgan, Dr. Owolabi is now the Principal Investigator of a three-year, 1.5 million dollar NSF grant called "Adapting an Experiment-centric Teaching Approach to Increase Student Achievement in Multiple STEM Disciplines" that spans many STEM disciplines. In the fields of STEM education and civil engineering, Dr. Owolabi is the author of more than 40 papers and presentations. He holds a Maryland professional engineering license.Dr. Owolabi continues to be a member of the Transportation Research Board's (TRB) Committee on Geo-Environmental and Climatic Impacts on Geomaterials (AKG300), where he is instrumental in promoting the sharing of knowledge and findings from transportation research. He does this by developing research problem statements and reviewing and endorsing papers for publication as well as TRB Annual Meetings.
