On Monday, as is customary, I went to the Business Hall and got started on Github. Since my git hub was current, I don't need to take any action.After forty minutes, our class discussed artificial intelligence and how it affects education.She discussed both the advantages and disadvantages of using AI in teaching.Even a video demonstrating how AI is being used in Chinese classrooms to increase student adaptability was shown by her.It was both clever and insane.Dr. Anita Pandey then led us in a writing and reading session. She gave lessons on writing as a method as well as an end to successful research.Furthermore, the writing-enhancing techniques and instruments.The conversation, synopsis, and understanding of the main ideas and structure.Following that, we had an undergraduate and high school teacher icebreaker where each group was given a high school teacher and they conversed with one another.We proceeded to the hall after our ten-minute introduction, and a group member from each group spoke about their high school teacher.After our group break, we got to work on our lab and the paper's research.There were two more people joined to our lab; they were from Illinois.They will be working on their own project during their five-week stay here.

I visited the lab on Tuesday, met with my mentor to discuss the article, and began doing research at the campus library.Using the sophisticated technology that allows me to filter the papers I want from the library, I was looking for the greatest paper in my college library.After reading the entire work through, I began drafting the synopsis and a few keywords.At the conclusion of the day, an odd event occurred.The noise filled the entire building.The fake fire alarm was the cause.After 20 minutes, we returned to pick up our luggage and left the premises as instructed by Morgan police, who had informed us to leave with all of the belongings, including the bags.
