I arrived in the lab on Monday and got to work creating a prototype for the North Campus Garage, but I failed because of coding issues.My code's boxes were giving me trouble.Following that, I spoke with my mentor and resumed.I ran that code using the video format as well.My laptop may have slowed down when running the code because of the large size, making it impossible to complete.


I started the lab with the same issue on Tuesday when I arrived.Naja emailed me shortly after to let me know that we do, in fact, have a presentation on Wednesday.It was my first time giving a presentation or speaking in front of a big crowd, so I was anxious.I began my own research, jotting down some ideas I had from the research article in a notepad, and I got to work on my practice for the next day.


My presentation was on the second, so as soon as I walked into the Behavioral and Social Science Centre on Wednesday, I started to feel anxious and frightened about it.Project 1 was initially referred to by Dr. Naja Mack.In order to gain some insight from them, I listened to them and observed their presentation.Dr. Naja then invited my group to the stage, where we began with introductions.I was anxious before I called my name, but after that, I felt like I was the only one who needed to have confidence.I was self-assured, and my presentation went smoothly.I remained there till four o'clock after that to listen to other groups.

My mentor informed me that we would be writing our paper starting on Sunday, so on Thursday I came to the lab and got started on the research paper that I had previously looked through and studied in depth.In order to prepare for my next paper writing, I was gathering as many ideas as I could from the papers and making notes regarding the approach in reference to the Dr. Anita Pandey writing session.

I visited my lab on Friday, and we had a discussion on how to improve the last presentation.I even prepared my github and created the sides for my weekly presentations.This day, too, I was concentrating on paper.I even spent some time watching the parking sense YouTube tutorial.
