When I arrived at the lab on Monday, we had a meeting to discuss our plans for the coming week.Since we have been working on a paper since last week, we have chosen to share our powerpoint summaries of the papers we have read.In addition, we were developing a methodology.Before the mid-presentation, we completed a prototype, and I was asked to create a flowchat of it.I began looking through the flowchart templates.

We held another meeting on Tuesday to discuss our actions from Monday.My group member and I began by uploading the introduction and methodology sections to a Google Drive so that my mentor could review and provide feedback.After that, I used Power Point to create a flowchart, and it worked out well.In addition, I went over the final exam papers and extracted the bullet points.

Wednesday -off

I arrived at the lab on Thursday and we had the same group meeting.Upon reviewing our Intro and Methodology, my mentor made comments and requested that we make the necessary corrections before the end of the break.He also showed us how to use the IEEE format for reference searches.The prior reference was APA; I changed it to IEEE and made other paragraph corrections.My mentor from high school was getting ready for his Friday presentation.We decided to have him present to us via a projector after he asked us to pay attention and give him a chance.It was really excellent.The presentation was excellent, in my opinion.Following that, I was also asked to create a presentation slide that included our prototype's images and videos.


I landed in the lab on Friday and got to work on the final, unfinished coding.A presentation was being worked on by members of my group.Since the beginning, I've been having some code issues, and I've come to the conclusion that the size of a photo and a video is the cause of the issue.Even though everything was going so well, the code ultimately failed.After the break, I resumed working on it and assisted a friend with the slide animation.
