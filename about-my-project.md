## About My Project
Enhancing Parking Efficiency through Predictive Modeling and Live Tracking.

Problem: There is a lack of reasearch focusing on parking sense.There are so many ways of parking ways which are not organized and tough for people to find the parking spot.

Approach: During this project, I will help my team in finding the techincal overview of a paring sense.
  -How can we save our time and get the easy access to the parking spot?
  -How can we use Firefly Algorith to find the parking spot?(Firefly Algorithm:(to enhance parking lot properties distance and area)
  -Using the optimization techniques to comeout from problem of parking space and wavelet transformm and AI nwtwork to reduce cost.

Expected Outcome: The project is expected to result in a conference poster presentation at the end of the CEAMLS program. The poster will focus on the system's technical architecture.
