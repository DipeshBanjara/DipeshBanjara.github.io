I arrived at my lab on Monday and we began with a meeting with my mentor, Pelumi.We were debating how to put the prototype into practice in a garage parking lot.We intended to carry it out on a garage on North Campus.For the model we're trying to develop, we went to the top floor of a North Campus Garage and took pictures, a video, and still images.We waited for a few cars to come up, but none did.Three of us made the decision to drive, and one of us chose to shoot the photo and the video.We arrived at the lab and got to work.

We were working on the Northcampus Garage prototype on Tuesday, but we ran into a number of issues, like a laptop that was lagging and code that wouldn't run because it was too big.We even worked on the slides and presentation.Our video was created to be posted on a presentation.We were working on our presentation and rehearsing it.I was quite anxious to speak in front of everyone.Dr. Anita Pandey also arrived and offered assistance with improving our presentation.

We were scheduled to give our presentation on a business hall on Wednesday, but owing to a technical issue, we had to reschedule. However, at eleven a.m., we were summoned to the business building to discuss the challenges we're having and the benefits we've been receiving from the internship thus far.It was interesting to hear every student there suggest solutions and discuss their advantages and problems.Following the session, we had lunch and got to work on the prototype using PyCharm.

Owing to the July 4th holiday, nobody visited the lab except for my tutor Pelumi and me, Khem Chand.We began using PyCharm, and my mentor also told us that he was going to ask Dr. Naja for a drone so that we could build a prototype in the parking lot and capture a 360-degree photo of it.Even though it's quite difficult, I spent the entire day trying to construct a prototype using the photo we shot.I was unable to attend.When I ran into difficulties, my mentor also offered assistance, but in the end, nothing worked.Hopefully, I'll finish it by next week.
