                                                    Monday 
I came to the location at 9:00 am in the morning and started with the Git Hub that we did on Friday last week. Michael showed us how to use the image we clicked on Friday to upload it to git hub.I did my CITI training and merely chatted about it with my friends and from 10 am Anita Pandey came for the group Writing Session and educated us about the writting a Reading.It was one of the best class and interesting seminar. She informed us how reading and writing is proportionate with each other and writing is merely one thing that determines our studies. .It was time for a break after the seminar, so my friends and I decided to eat lunch before heading to our research lab to begin working on the reading that Pelumi Abiodum had assigned us. He gave us a pdf to read and instructed us to jot down the summary.He instructed us to summarize any two of the seven PDFs for the time being.The PDF discussed a better vehicle parking mechanism that uses machine learning to predict parking occupancy and the firefly algorithm to shorten the time it takes to find a parking space.


                                                      Tuesday
I arrived at the research room of the CBEIS building.We talked about the summary, and the mentor gave us some additional parking-related ideas. Subsequently, he inquired about the Kaggle machine learning introduction. From there, he requested information on four main topics: feature engineering, data visualization, intermediate machine learning, and introduction to machine learning.For the entire day, my buddies and I attempted to learn an introduction to machine language.


                                                      Wednesday
I got into the research centre and started doing our incomplete Kaggle exercise and got my first certificate of Intro to Machine Learning.I got to learn about the pandas and python code. I spent my whole day on finding the summary and the certificate.


                                                       Thursday
I arrived at the research center, where I began to study some Python code from YouTube and put it to use on a Replit. Anita Pandey is scheduled to attend a conference at one, according to my mentor.To ensure that we arrive on time and meet my mentor, she has agreed to give us a lunch break at twelve.She arrived at one, and we immediately got to work talking about a variety of subjects.She explained how writing directly relates to writing.What function does a paper's title serve in a research paper?What function do the keywords serve in the paper? How can we use AI to improve the effectiveness of our parking system?She stressed quality over quantity while teaching about papers.Following the session, we took our photo and began reading the paper in more detail.After teaching us how to search a document, my mentor Pelumi assigned us each to conduct research on 15 sheets of paper and complete the blank places in the excel sheet he is creating for us.

                                                       Friday
When I first arrived at the lab, I used the templates that Dr. Naja Mack had supplied me. I began working with my pal to create the group powerpoint.Following the PowerPoint presentation, my mentor Peumi looked over it, assisted in fixing the problem, and helped us with our Zoom group video.My mentor then gave us access to an Excel page on which we could enter the author's name, the publication date, the citation, the references, and a host of other details.We even made the decision to spend the remaining time working on pandas and machine learning, which will enable us to develop our parking system using artificial intelligence rather than algebra.
