I arrived at the lab on Monday, and we had a meeting with my mentor to discuss our plans for the week leading up to the final.We talked about updating the midsummer presentation, figures, content, and structures in the final symposium presentation.The Introduction, Literature Review, Methodology, Results, or Discussion were other topics of discussion.I learned how to make an elevator pitch from my mentor as well.The summer research group's elevator pitch from the previous year was also shown to us.Following the meeting, we began to plot how we were going to produce our film.High school teachers brainstormed ideas for their elevator pitches and got to work planning one of them.We practised our dialogue by going to the dialogue site.

We began writing our introductions independently on Tuesday in order to gather additional ideas, combine them, and create the greatest one possible.Everyone was occupied with their video dialogue and research.After some time, we moved to the adjacent room where we created a demo movie and spent some time practicing.Everyone was focused on the video because we just wanted to create the best one.We then convened for a meeting to continue our conversation.

Arriving at the lab, my group member and the high school teacher began filming our elevator pitch.My guide assisted us in filming the video.We recorded a few videos with my camera.Every member of my group made an equal contribution to the video.My group member urged me to modify this as well because I used to alter videos at random.To improve it, I added transition on each take.I made three distinct kinds so that the members of my group may select one. We also held a brief discussion to discuss our plans for today.Our intention was to draft a methodology.
