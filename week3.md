Monday,I arrived at the Business building around 9:00 am and got to work on Github.I uploaded my photo last week, but again Mr. Michael showed us how to do it for the one who haven’t completed it.He began educating us about the overleaf after the GitHub.I updated my mentor intro on both GitHub and Overleaf, and I figured out how to post the photo on overleaf.I posted my project, my introduction, and the blogs for weeks one and two. Dr. Anita Pandey arrived at ten and gave a presentation regarding the writing.She gave lessons on the methods, techniques, and resources for improving writing through discussion, outlining, information, criticism, re-outlining, and editing.She even gave us advice on organizing. Appropriate visual space, introduction, body, conclusion, appendices, references, acknowledgements, and disclaimer were among the advice given. She explained the significance that language and academic presentation have in writing, including the use of transitions, short sentences, important terms, subheadings, passive voice, visual aids, and citations from reliable sources. We also learned more about ways to prevent plagiarism by paraphrasing and using transitions.Following the conference, I had lunch, and Dr. Anita Pandey stopped by my lab to inquire about our research.Which sources are we using, and what do we really type to locate the papers?I began looking through the journals and materials for my project after she departed.

Tuesday,I arrived at the research room of the CBEIS building.My mentor is in other state for his presentation.Even though he is out of state he conducted a google meeting for us so that he can help us what’s going on with the project.Everything was going well and we he sent us a excel sheet on our drive and we started searching for a paper for a whole day.I found two of the paper a filled up on a excel.The paper was about using AI model for parking and for it effectiveness.

Wednesday,I began by studying the intermediate machine learning summary and working my way up to machine learning.I spent the entire day doing that.I've even gone through the entire document only to look for the keywords and understand how each section of the subtitles functions.

Thursday,I was really happy for this day since I had received a letter from Dr. Naja Mack regarding my field trip to John Hopkins, and it was one of the most interesting days of my life.I arrived at the CBEIS building a little early, and my buddies and I boarded my bus to travel to the John Hopkins Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.Before we could in, there were various security checks.We were given a card that allows us to access the gate.It was forbidden for us to remove our smart watches and phones.They split us up into two factions.In the first lecture, we learned about the operation of AI and its detection capabilities; the second seminar was much more fascinating.A John Hopkins software developer showed us a website where we could text or draw anything and it would turn into a three-dimensional image.The scientist's ice melting was the subject of the other one.The topic of discussion was how to modulate the weather prediction and regulate ICE melting by 2030.The Boston Robot was the subject of the final one, and neurons were the subject of the other.I found it to be interesting.The robot alone cost about $75,000, and anything you develop inside of it is your own.It has a lifting capacity of roughly 40 pounds, and it may actively assist in locating objects within buildings and even assist in human intrusion.We came back to college after lunch and went back to home and woked frim my home again.

Friday,I came to my lab,me along with my friends had a meeting with a mentor.We talked about how can we use our skills on searching paper.He taught us how to find the paper using the Advanced Tools.He taught us how can we know what paper that we need to choose the paper related to our research and I worked on a presentation and a video and did my excel.
